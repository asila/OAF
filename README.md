## OAF
Data sharing for seasonal yields and freshly sampled soils pxrf data.

Yield data was provided by OAF while pXRF was analyzed at ICRAF.
pXRF measurements are reported in %.

### Note
Linking ICRAF pXRF data to OAF season yield data was challege due to different farm names used in the two tables.

There were only two farms with same farmer name appearing in both tables. The farmer names are - Margaret Mukhwana and Emily Mapesa.

### R-script file
In addition we provide an R-script for overlaying freshly sampled points and farms with seasonal yields.
